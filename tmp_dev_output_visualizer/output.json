Having this data, we were thinking, we read your requirements, we would like to be able to give the ability to consider also prices when choosing a school.\nSo we would like to have an additional column in your application. So here, right next to these, also have a price. To do that, we thought of selecting the packages that satisfy these requirements that we just got from the users.\nSo they say all the hours that they want to have and like having the first lesson, lesson for lecture for free, all of these. We just look at all the schools that satisfy these requirements and just propose a minimum price that gives you this, all the things that you want.\nWould that be a solution for you?"

With the new system they will not have to select sorting because we have a default now.\nAnd the default you said will be the distance, so from the closest to the most.\nWe said this one, the percentage high-low.\nOkay, so in the new system you want the percentage as the sorting.\nAs the default.\nOkay. And that should be enough for you to have results. Yeah.\nIt is also possible to use filters. So, we will maintain all the existing filters. So, the percentage of success, the number of exams, and the distance.\nBut we will change the distance filter, so yeah, we'll just change the range because right now it's too, it allows to go to 50 kilometers. Which is too much. And allow for smaller steps, so steps of 2 kilometers.\nWe will maintain these existing filters, so yeah. All of these just stay. And we just add the possibility to textually describe the things that they want, the services they want in their packages.\nAnd then choose from a list. So, yeah, that's going to be also an option to just insert a list of minimum requirements. Yeah.\nYeah. And this will be used to display the results. The results, all the compressed results, all the columns will stay the same, but we'll add a new column for the starting from, right?\nYeah. In the expanded view, we maintain all of what it is, there is right now. But we add the packages displayed with a similar graphic to this one.\nOkay. And, yeah, that should be it for the user perspective. Then from the perspective of the schools, the schools should be able to log in, so they have a profile.\nAnd they're able to provide us with all this information. So, yeah, all of what we listed before were the location of their school, the phone number, and the prices of what they offer. And, yeah, that should be it from their side.\nAnd from your side, it should be possible to insert new exams. So, select a school and specify for that school how many exams were passed or failed. And this information will then be shown to the users.\nAnd, yeah. Yeah. It's, yeah, also there's another functionality which will be for you to be able to modify the list of possible services.\nYeah, of course. That's to maintain your application. And, yeah, we'll then make a small report of how we handle the sorting, so that you can be more transparent to the schools on how they're sorted.\nBut there should not be any functionality there. No. For the transparency side.\nAnd, yeah, that should be it about the process. And shall we also summarize the information that we keep, or is that clear? Hmm.\nSo... Where is it?
