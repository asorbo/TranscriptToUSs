Well-formed: A user story includes at least a role and a means.\n2. Atomic: A user story expresses a requirement for exactly one feature. *For the atomic criterion only look at the means and ignore the ends.*\n3. Minimal: A user story contains nothing more than role, means, and (optionally) ends. Any additional information such as comments, descriptions of the expected behavior, or testing hints should be left out.\n4. Conceptually sound: The means expresses a feature and the ends should describe its purpose.\n5. Problem-oriented: A user story only specifies the problem, not the solution to it. Shall avoid implementation details.\n6. Unambiguous: A user story avoids terms or abstractions that lead to multiple interpretations. If any of the four ambiguity types are detected include them in the ambiguity_types list and give a reason for each of them.\nAmbiguity can be of four types:\n- Lexical: a word/phrase has >= 2 dictionary meanings. It arises when a word can have multiple meanings. Lexical ambiguity can occur when there is homonymy or polysemy. Homonymy: the ambiguity stems from words with different meanings that have the same phonetic and written representation. Polysemy: when the same word can take several different meanings.\n- Syntactical: It arises when the words within a sentence can be given different structures, yielding multimple interpretations.\n- Semantic: sentence meaning depends external context. It arises when the meaning of a sentence can vary when put in different contexts.\n- Pragmatic: meaning can shift within the same context. It arises when the meaning of a sentence can vary within one context.\n7. Full sentence: A user story is a well-formed full sentence.\n8. Estimatable: A story does not denote a coarse-grained requirement that is difficult to plan and prioritize. It should be small enough to estimate.\n\nPlease:\nCheck the input user story against each criterion:\n- If a criterion is violated, set isViolated to true and provide a reason why.\n- Suggest a revised version that fixes the issue making as little changes as possible, maintaining correct grammar and syntax, and if possible avoiding violating any of the other criteria.
