        "CHECK_CRITERIA_VIOLATIONS_PROMPT": "\nYou are an expert requirements engineer evaluating a user story for compliance with 8 criteria.\nRecall that a user story is structured as such: \"AS A [role], I WANT [means], SO THAT [ends].\"\n\nHere are the 8 criteria:\n1. Well-formed: A user story includes at least a role and a means.\n2. Atomic: A user story expresses a requirement for exactly one feature. *For the atomic criterion only look at the means and ignore the ends.*\n3. Minimal: A user story contains nothing more than role, means, and (optionally) ends. Any additional information such as comments, descriptions of the expected behavior, or testing hints should be left out.\n4. Conceptually sound: The means expresses a feature and the ends should describe its purpose.\n5. Problem-oriented: A user story only specifies the problem, not the solution to it. Shall avoid implementation details.\n6. Unambiguous: A user story avoids terms or abstractions that lead to multiple interpretations. If any of the four ambiguity types are detected include them in the ambiguity_types list and give a reason for each of them.\nAmbiguity can be of four types:\n- Lexical: a word/phrase has >= 2 dictionary meanings. It arises when a word can have multiple meanings. Lexical ambiguity can occur when there is homonymy or polysemy. Homonymy: the ambiguity stems from words with different meanings that have the same phonetic and written representation. Polysemy: when the same word can take several different meanings.\n- Syntactical: It arises when the words within a sentence can be given different structures, yielding multimple interpretations.\n- Semantic: sentence meaning depends external context. It arises when the meaning of a sentence can vary when put in different contexts.\n- Pragmatic: meaning can shift within the same context. It arises when the meaning of a sentence can vary within one context.\n7. Full sentence: A user story is a well-formed full sentence.\n8. Estimatable: A story does not denote a coarse-grained requirement that is difficult to plan and prioritize. It should be small enough to estimate.\n\nPlease:\nCheck the input user story against each criterion:\n- If a criterion is violated, set isViolated to true and provide a reason why.\n- Suggest a revised version that fixes the issue making as little changes as possible, maintaining correct grammar and syntax, and if possible avoiding violating any of the other criteria. The improvement field should contain a string or a slist of strings in case the improvement splits the original user story into two or more.\nOnly if the suggested fixes for each criteria do not conflict with eachother, provide a final revised version as either a string or list of strings taking into consideration all the criteria violations previously identified.\n\nExamples of correct outputs for each criteria:\nInput:\nI want to see an error when I cannot see recommendations after I upload an article\nOutput (extract):\n\"Well-formed\": {\n    \"isViolated\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The user story does not adhere to the correct syntax, as it has no role.\",\n    \"improvement\": None\n  }\n\nInput:\nAs a User, I am able to click a particular location from the map and thereby perform a search of landmarks associated with that latitude longitude combination\nOutput (extract):\n  \"Atomic\": {\n    \"isViolated\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The user story consists of two separate requirements: the act of clicking on a location and the display of associated landmarks.
