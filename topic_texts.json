So we thought of standardizing this.\nSo we're going to handle the figuring out of what services are offered and just make a list of them. And then the schools will be able to specify their their plans based on these. So for example, they will say, yeah, we have the exam pocket.\nAnd then they will have a, they can just include all of this. They just search auto relish. And then if it's a possibility, they just select it.\nOkay. This will always be a possibility, of course. Nevermind.\nI mean, yeah. Relish this one as a possibility. And if it comes up, they just can select it and edit.\nSo we just build a list of all of these. That means that we will provide you, of course, with an initial list. It will be as comprehensive as possible.\nIt may be that in the future, new things will pop up. So let's say a school will offer free rides with a scooter to get to the school, like with a something like that. Of course, they need to be able to put it in a system, but to keep it standardized, it would be then you needing to include this.\nSo they may message you and tell you, this is not an option. So is it okay for you to manage this to ensure that it's..."
